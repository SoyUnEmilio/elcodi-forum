Elcodi forum
============

This is our Forum. We wanted to do something special, 
using Github Issue tracking as a simple forum engine.

How does it works?

Each label represents a category, so a simple post 
can pertain to several categories. The good point 
is that an existing post can be recategorized as 
many times as needed.

You can subscribe to this repository to be aware 
of the latest developments or responses.

Book Club Forum
------------------------

In Elcodi we have just started a new Book Club. 
One of the tools that we will have to discuss the 
books that we read, is the forum, so if you are 
interested in this club, don't forget to follow us 
on Twitter ( [@elcodi_dev](http://twitter.com/elcodi_dev) ).

Every week we will discuss here the chapter read 
by people, sharing ideas, code and good development :)

Elcodi Forum
------------------

We also provide a forum to discuss all project development. 
Our mission is not to provide a full stack framework 
developed by a company. Our mission is to lead a project 
development, result of the real needs of developers, 
companies and clients, and designed, discussed and executed 
by all the community.

Do you have something to say? Welcome :)
